# AI Codegen Client

The AI Codegen Client is the React frontend for the AI code generation platform. It provides the product interface for browsing generated apps, creating new apps from prompts, chatting with the AI code generator, previewing generated output, deploying Vite projects, editing app metadata, and managing users, apps, and chat history from admin pages.

The client is built with React 19, Vite, TypeScript, React Router, TanStack Query, TanStack Form, Zod, Tailwind CSS, and a small shared UI system. Runtime configuration is validated with Zod, server responses are decoded through schemas, and streaming code generation is consumed through Server-Sent Events.

## Overview

This package contains the browser application for the AI code generation product.

Default local development URL:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Default backend API URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api
```

The frontend communicates with the backend through:

- JSON APIs for users, apps, chat history, deployment, and admin pages.
- Server-Sent Events for streaming AI-generated code.
- Static preview URLs for generated output.
- Deployed Vite app URLs for built projects.

The app is intentionally schema-driven. Runtime environment variables, route parameters, API responses, stream events, branded IDs, pagination, admin filters, visual editor payloads, and domain objects are validated with Zod before use.

## Core Capabilities

### App Discovery

The home page lists public or featured generated apps and provides a prompt composer for starting a new generation flow.

Capabilities:

- Browse generated apps.
- Search or paginate app cards.
- Open app detail modals.
- Start a new app from an initial prompt.
- Navigate to an app chat workspace.

### AI Chat Workspace

The app chat page is the primary generation workspace.

Capabilities:

- Load app metadata and chat history.
- Stream AI output from the backend.
- Render user and AI messages.
- Preview generated output in an iframe.
- Refresh preview content with versioned URLs.
- Use deployed Vite URLs when an app has a deployment key.
- Avoid automatically re-running generation when a deployed app already exists.
- Display selected visual editor element context.

### App Editing and Deployment

The app edit page supports app metadata and deployment workflows.

Capabilities:

- Edit app information.
- Trigger deployment.
- Open deployed URLs.
- Show deployment success modal.
- Copy deployed URL.

### Admin Management

Admin pages provide operational management interfaces.

Capabilities:

- Manage users.
- Manage apps.
- Manage chat history.
- Filter and paginate admin tables.
- Protect admin routes with role checks.

### User Authentication

The client supports:

- Registration.
- Login.
- Session hydration.
- Authenticated route protection.
- Admin route protection.
- Unauthorized API handling.

## Architecture

The client follows a layered structure:

```text
React app
  -> app providers
  -> router
  -> page modules
  -> shared query hooks
  -> shared API clients
  -> HTTP client and SSE client
  -> backend Hono API
```

Core principles:

- Pages own route-level composition and feature-specific UI.
- Shared modules own reusable APIs, schemas, hooks, layout, auth, and UI primitives.
- Zod schemas validate all trust boundaries.
- TanStack Query owns server state and cache invalidation.
- Zustand owns lightweight client auth state.
- Components are kept small and colocated with their tests and stories.

Application providers are assembled in:

```text
src/app/app-providers.tsx
```

The router is defined in:

```text
src/app/app-router.tsx
```

The Vite entry point is:

```text
src/main.tsx
```

## Runtime Requirements

Recommended local tools:

- Node.js compatible with Vite 7 and React 19.
- pnpm through the repository workspace.
- A running AI Codegen Server.
- A browser with modern ES module support.

The frontend does not directly talk to Ollama, PostgreSQL, Redis, or MinIO. Those dependencies belong to the backend. The frontend only needs the backend API URL and deployed app domain URL.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the backend server first. By default, it should listen on:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd client
pnpm dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

If the backend runs on a different URL, configure `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## Runtime Configuration

Runtime environment variables are parsed in:

```text
src/shared/schemas/runtime-env.ts
src/shared/config/runtime-env.ts
```

The schema is:

```ts
VITE_API_BASE_URL: string URL
VITE_DEPLOY_DOMAIN: string URL
```

Defaults:

| Variable             | Default                          | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`  | `http://localhost:3000/api`      | Backend API base URL. Used by JSON APIs and SSE stream URLs.             |
| `VITE_DEPLOY_DOMAIN` | `http://localhost:3000/api/dist` | Base domain for deployed Vite apps. Used by deploy preview URL builders. |

Example local `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_DEPLOY_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000/api/dist
```

The repository currently does not require a client `.env` file for default local development because both variables have safe local defaults.

## Application Routes

Routes are defined in `src/app/app-router.tsx`.

Public routes:

| Path             | Page               | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `/`              | `HomePage`         | App discovery and prompt entry. |
| `/user/login`    | `UserLoginPage`    | Login screen.                   |
| `/user/register` | `UserRegisterPage` | Registration screen.            |

Authenticated routes:

| Path            | Page          | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/app/chat/:id` | `AppChatPage` | AI chat and preview workspace.       |
| `/app/edit/:id` | `AppEditPage` | App metadata editing and deployment. |

Admin routes:

| Path                 | Page                  | Description              |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/admin/user-manage` | `AdminUserManagePage` | User management.         |
| `/admin/app-manage`  | `AdminAppManagePage`  | App management.          |
| `/admin/chat-manage` | `AdminChatManagePage` | Chat history management. |

Legacy camelCase admin paths redirect to kebab-case paths:

```text
/admin/userManage -> /admin/user-manage
/admin/appManage -> /admin/app-manage
/admin/chatManage -> /admin/chat-manage
```

Unknown routes redirect to `/`.

## API Layer

API code lives under:

```text
src/shared/api/
```

Important files:

```text
http-client.ts              Generic HTTP request client
http-client-singleton.ts    Shared client instance
decode-envelope.ts          Response envelope decoding
app-api.ts                  App APIs and deployment APIs
user-api.ts                 User authentication and admin user APIs
chat-history-api.ts         Chat history APIs
chat-stream-client.ts       Server-Sent Events client
chat-stream-parser.ts       Stream event parser
unauthorized-handler.ts     Unauthorized response handling
api-error.ts                Typed API exception model
```

Endpoint paths are defined in:

```text
src/shared/config/endpoints.ts
```

Current endpoint groups include:

```text
app/awesome/list/page/vo
chat-history/app/:appId
chat-history/admin/list/page/vo
app/chat/codegen
```

The API layer validates response envelopes and payloads with Zod. Callers receive typed parsed data rather than untrusted raw JSON.

## Streaming Code Generation

Streaming generation uses Server-Sent Events through `@microsoft/fetch-event-source`.

Main files:

```text
src/shared/api/chat-stream-client.ts
src/shared/api/chat-stream-parser.ts
src/pages/app-chat/use-chat-session.ts
src/pages/app-chat/app-chat-workspace.tsx
```

Stream event handling supports:

- `message` events for incremental generated text chunks.
- `done` events for successful completion.
- `business-error` events for workflow-level failures.
- Ignored events for unsupported or empty payloads.
- Abort handling through `AbortSignal`.
- Network error mapping into `ApiException`.

The stream client sends credentials:

```ts
credentials: "include";
```

This is required because backend authentication is session-based.

## Authentication

Authentication code lives under:

```text
src/shared/auth/
```

Key modules:

```text
auth-boundary.tsx
auth-hydration-gate.tsx
require-auth.tsx
require-admin.tsx
user-store.ts
```

Responsibilities:

- Hydrate the current session at app startup.
- Store the current user in a lightweight client store.
- Block authenticated routes until auth state is known.
- Redirect unauthenticated users away from protected routes.
- Restrict admin pages to admin users.
- Clear or refresh user state when API calls return unauthorized responses.

The root provider composition is:

```tsx
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <BrowserRouter>
    <AuthBoundary>
      <AuthHydrationGate fallback={<PageLoader />}>
        {children}
      </AuthHydrationGate>
    </AuthBoundary>
  </BrowserRouter>
</QueryClientProvider>
```

## State and Server Cache

The client uses TanStack Query for server state.

Relevant files:

```text
src/shared/query/query-client.ts
src/shared/query/query-keys.ts
src/shared/query/hooks/use-app-queries.ts
src/shared/query/hooks/use-app-mutations.ts
src/shared/query/hooks/use-user-queries.ts
src/shared/query/hooks/use-user-mutations.ts
src/shared/query/hooks/use-chat-history-queries.ts
```

Use TanStack Query for:

- App lists.
- App details.
- User queries.
- Chat history.
- Admin tables.
- Mutations with invalidation.

Use local React state for:

- Form-local UI state.
- Modal open state.
- Preview refresh counters.
- In-progress stream text.
- Selected visual editor context.

Use Zustand auth state for:

- Current user.
- Auth hydration status.
- Login/logout state transitions.

## Pages

### Home Page

Directory:

```text
src/pages/home/
```

Responsibilities:

- Render prompt composer.
- Render app sections and app cards.
- Build app list query params.
- Provide quick prompts.
- Navigate into generation flow.

Important files:

```text
home-page.tsx
prompt-composer.tsx
app-section.tsx
quick-prompts.ts
app-list-params.ts
home-actions.ts
```

### App Chat Page

Directory:

```text
src/pages/app-chat/
```

Responsibilities:

- Load app metadata and chat history.
- Manage chat stream lifecycle.
- Append streamed AI chunks.
- Render messages.
- Render generated preview iframe.
- Refresh static or deployed previews.
- Track selected visual editor context.
- Avoid duplicate auto-generation for already deployed apps.

Important files:

```text
app-chat-page.tsx
app-chat-workspace.tsx
app-chat-content.tsx
use-chat-session.ts
use-chat-history-feed.ts
preview-panel.tsx
message-list.tsx
chat-composer.tsx
chat-actions.tsx
chat-stream-url.ts
selected-element-context.ts
use-visual-editor.ts
```

### App Edit Page

Directory:

```text
src/pages/app-edit/
```

Responsibilities:

- Edit app metadata.
- Validate edit forms.
- Submit app updates.
- Trigger deployment.
- Display deployment success.
- Open deployed URLs.

Important files:

```text
app-edit-page.tsx
app-edit-content.tsx
app-edit-form.tsx
app-edit-form-schema.ts
app-edit-toolbar.tsx
app-edit-info-panel.tsx
```

### Admin Pages

Directories:

```text
src/pages/admin-user-manage/
src/pages/admin-app-manage/
src/pages/admin-chat-manage/
src/pages/admin-shared/
```

Responsibilities:

- Render paginated admin tables.
- Manage filter values.
- Format admin values.
- Use shared data-table UI.
- Protect routes with `RequireAdmin`.

## Shared UI

Reusable UI components live under:

```text
src/shared/ui/
```

Examples:

```text
app-card.tsx
app-detail-modal.tsx
auth-card.tsx
avatar.tsx
badge.tsx
button.tsx
confirmation-dialog.tsx
data-table.tsx
deploy-success-modal.tsx
empty-state.tsx
error-boundary.tsx
error-state.tsx
loading-state.tsx
markdown-renderer.tsx
page-container.tsx
page-loader.tsx
pagination-controls.tsx
text-area.tsx
text-field.tsx
user-info.tsx
```

Modal components that must remain centered in the browser viewport use React portals to render into `document.body`. This avoids centering relative to a long scrolled page container.

The common modal pattern is:

- Portal to `document.body`.
- Overlay with `fixed inset-0`.
- Scroll-safe wrapper with `overflow-y-auto`.
- Dialog max height based on `100dvh`.

## Generated App Preview

The chat workspace renders generated output inside a preview panel.

There are two preview URL modes:

- Static generated output preview.
- Deployed Vite app preview.

Static preview URLs are used before deployment. Deployed URLs are used after an app has a `deployKey`.

URL helpers live in:

```text
src/shared/config/urls.ts
```

Important helpers:

```text
getStaticPreviewUrl(codegenType, appId)
getDeployUrl(deployKey)
```

Preview refresh appends a version query parameter:

```text
?v=<number>
```

This forces the iframe to reload without changing the underlying deployed path semantics.

## Vite Deployment URLs

Generated Vite apps are served by the backend under:

```text
/api/dist/<deployKey>/index.html
```

The frontend builds deployed URLs with:

```ts
getDeployUrl(deployKey);
```

The expected default result is:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/dist/<deployKey>/index.html
```

The explicit `index.html` segment is important. Vite build output commonly contains relative assets:

```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="./assets/index.css" />
```

When the document URL is:

```text
/api/dist/<deployKey>/index.html?v=1
```

the browser resolves assets under:

```text
/api/dist/<deployKey>/assets/...
```

If the document URL were:

```text
/api/dist/<deployKey>?v=1
```

the browser could resolve `./assets/...` under the wrong path:

```text
/api/dist/assets/...
```

For this reason, deployed previews and refreshes should always use the `index.html` URL form.

## Forms and Validation

The frontend uses Zod for validation and type derivation.

Schema directories:

```text
src/shared/schemas/
src/pages/app-edit/app-edit-form-schema.ts
```

Important schema groups:

```text
admin-filters.ts
app.ts
base-response.ts
branded-ids.ts
chat-history.ts
chat-stream.ts
codegen-type.ts
pagination.ts
primitives.ts
route-params.ts
runtime-env.ts
user.ts
user-role.ts
visual-editor.ts
```

ID handling:

- API-facing IDs may arrive as numbers, int-like strings, or bigint-like values.
- Frontend schemas normalize transport IDs to branded strings.
- JSON requests should send ID values as strings.
- This avoids JavaScript `bigint` JSON serialization failures.

## Markdown Rendering

Generated AI responses can contain Markdown and code blocks.

Markdown rendering is implemented in:

```text
src/shared/ui/markdown-renderer.tsx
src/shared/ui/render-safe-markdown.ts
src/shared/ui/highlight-code-blocks.ts
```

The renderer uses:

- `marked` for Markdown parsing.
- `dompurify` for sanitization.
- Safe rendering helpers to avoid injecting untrusted HTML.

Always treat model output as untrusted input.

## Styling

The client uses Tailwind CSS through the Vite plugin:

```text
@tailwindcss/vite
```

Global styles live in:

```text
src/index.css
```

Class composition helpers:

```text
src/shared/lib/cn.ts
```

UI components use utility classes directly. Prefer reusable primitives from `src/shared/ui/` when adding new screens.

## Build Optimization

Vite configuration lives in:

```text
vite.config.ts
```

The build uses manual vendor chunks:

| Chunk             | Packages                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `vendor-react`    | React, React DOM, React Router, Scheduler |
| `vendor-tanstack` | TanStack packages                         |
| `vendor-markdown` | Marked and DOMPurify                      |
| `vendor-icons`    | Lucide React                              |
| `vendor-motion`   | GSAP and Animate.css                      |
| `vendor-core`     | Remaining node_modules dependencies       |

The alias `@` points to:

```text
src/
```

Vitest uses:

```text
jsdom
src/setup-tests.ts
```

## Development Commands

Run commands from the `client` directory unless your workspace tooling forwards package scripts.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Starts the Vite development server.

```bash
pnpm build
```

Runs TypeScript build mode and then creates a Vite production build.

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Serves the production build locally through Vite preview.

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Runs ESLint with zero warnings allowed.

```bash
pnpm format
```

Formats `src/` with Prettier and Tailwind class sorting.

```bash
pnpm test
```

Runs the Vitest test suite.

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

Runs TypeScript build mode without emitting output.

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

Starts Storybook on port `6006`.

```bash
pnpm storybook:build
```

Builds static Storybook output.

## Testing

The client uses Vitest, React Testing Library, jsdom, and MSW-style test helpers.

Test setup:

```text
src/setup-tests.ts
src/test/render-with-providers.tsx
src/test/http-test-helpers.ts
```

Common test categories:

- Router and route guard behavior.
- Auth hydration.
- API response decoding.
- Query hooks.
- App chat streaming and preview behavior.
- Form validation.
- Admin page filtering and table behavior.
- Markdown sanitization.
- Runtime environment parsing.
- URL helper behavior.
- Branded ID normalization.

Run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run a focused test file:

```bash
pnpm vitest run src/shared/config/urls.test.ts
```

Use focused tests for URL semantics, stream parsing, schema changes, and route guard changes because these areas are easy to regress.

## Storybook

Storybook is configured for component development and visual inspection.

Start Storybook:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

Build Storybook:

```bash
pnpm storybook:build
```

Story files are colocated with the components or pages they document. Examples:

```text
src/pages/app-chat/app-chat.stories.tsx
src/pages/admin-shared/admin-tables.stories.tsx
src/shared/ui/app-card.stories.tsx
src/shared/ui/feedback-states.stories.tsx
src/shared/ui/foundation.stories.tsx
src/shared/ui/markdown-renderer.stories.tsx
src/shared/ui/modals.stories.tsx
```

Story fixtures should be parsed through the same Zod schemas used by production code whenever possible. This keeps Storybook aligned with real runtime contracts.

## Production Build

Build the frontend:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the built output:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Deployment checklist:

- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the public backend API URL.
- Set `VITE_DEPLOY_DOMAIN` to the public deployed-app domain.
- Ensure backend CORS allows the frontend origin.
- Ensure cookies or session credentials are valid for the deployed domain setup.
- Verify `/api/dist/<deployKey>/index.html` is reachable for deployed Vite apps.
- Verify deployed Vite assets resolve under `/api/dist/<deployKey>/assets/...`.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`.
- Run `pnpm lint`.
- Run `pnpm test`.
- Run `pnpm build`.

## Type and Validation Rules

This project follows strict TypeScript and runtime validation rules.

Guidelines:

- Keep `strict` TypeScript enabled.
- Validate external data with Zod before use.
- Derive types from schemas instead of duplicating interfaces.
- Avoid unsafe type assertions.
- Avoid `any`.
- Keep ID transport values as strings after normalization.
- Keep filenames and directories in kebab-case.
- Keep code-adjacent text in English.
- Keep components and modules small and responsibility-focused.

Important boundaries that require validation:

- Runtime environment variables.
- Route params.
- Query params.
- API responses.
- API request bodies.
- SSE event payloads.
- Visual editor messages.
- Storybook fixtures.
- Test fixtures that model backend contracts.

## Troubleshooting

### The App Cannot Reach the Backend

Check:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to the backend API prefix.
- Backend is running.
- Backend CORS allows the frontend origin.
- Browser requests include credentials where needed.
- The backend API prefix matches the configured client URL.

Default expected pairing:

```text
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend:  http://localhost:3000/api
```

### Login Succeeds but Auth State Is Lost

Check:

- Backend session cookie is set.
- Requests use `credentials: "include"`.
- CORS allows credentials.
- Cookie domain and SameSite settings are compatible with the deployment.
- `AuthHydrationGate` is not blocked by a failed current-user request.

### Code Generation Stream Does Not Display Output

Check:

- The app route is authenticated.
- The stream URL points to `app/chat/codegen`.
- The backend emits SSE events.
- The stream parser recognizes event kinds.
- The browser did not abort the request.
- The backend logs do not show a business error.

### Refresh Opens a Static Preview Instead of a Deployed App

If the app has a `deployKey`, the preview URL should come from:

```ts
getDeployUrl(app.deployKey);
```

not from:

```ts
getStaticPreviewUrl(app.codegenType, app.id);
```

Inspect `src/pages/app-chat/app-chat-workspace.tsx` if this behavior regresses.

### Deployed Vite Assets Resolve to the Wrong Path

The deployed URL must include `index.html`:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/dist/<deployKey>/index.html
```

If the iframe loads:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/dist/<deployKey>?v=1
```

relative assets may resolve incorrectly.

Check:

```text
src/shared/config/urls.ts
src/shared/config/urls.test.ts
```

### Deployment Success URL Is Duplicated

The deployment API may return a full deployed URL. Do not pass a full URL into a helper that expects only a deploy key.

Correct behavior:

- Use the response URL directly when the API returns a URL.
- Use `getDeployUrl(deployKey)` only when the value is a deploy key.

### Modal Is Not Centered on Long Pages

Modal overlays should be rendered with a portal into `document.body`.

Check modal implementations:

```text
src/shared/ui/app-detail-modal.tsx
src/shared/ui/deploy-success-modal.tsx
```

Expected pattern:

- `createPortal`.
- `fixed inset-0`.
- `items-center justify-center`.
- `overflow-y-auto`.
- Dialog max height based on `100dvh`.

### Storybook Fails Because a Fixture Is Invalid

Storybook fixtures should satisfy production schemas.

If a visual editor fixture fails, inspect:

```text
src/shared/schemas/visual-editor.ts
```

Then update the story fixture to include all required fields.

### API ID Validation Fails

Frontend ID schemas normalize IDs into branded strings.

Check:

```text
src/shared/schemas/branded-ids.ts
```

When sending JSON, ensure IDs are serialized as strings.

### Markdown Rendering Looks Unsafe or Broken

Check:

```text
src/shared/ui/render-safe-markdown.ts
src/shared/ui/markdown-renderer.tsx
```

Do not render raw model output directly as HTML without sanitization.

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep `src/shared/schemas/` aligned with backend response contracts.
- Add or update tests when changing URL helpers, stream parsing, auth guards, or ID schemas.
- Keep `VITE_DEPLOY_DOMAIN` aligned with backend `CODEGEN_DEPLOY_HOST` and static deploy routes.
- Use `getDeployUrl()` for deploy-key-based URLs and direct API response URLs when the server returns a complete URL.
- Prefer shared query hooks over ad hoc API calls in page components.
- Prefer shared UI primitives over one-off component styling.
- Keep Storybook fixtures valid against production schemas.
- Keep route paths, navigation links, and route guards synchronized.
- Treat AI-generated Markdown as untrusted content.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm test` before merging substantial changes.
